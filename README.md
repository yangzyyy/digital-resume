## Projects and Experiences

#### Deep Learning Project in Computer Vision (NUS, Jan 2023 - May 2023) 

* Collaborated with a group of 7 members with main responsibility of leading algorithm implementations using Python.
* Designed Machine Learning models based on PyTorch, torchvision, and torch-mimicry using Jupyter Notebook.                               
* Proved that current StyleGAN and SNGAN model generated images lacking in high-frequency components.
* Upgraded StyleGAN and SNGAN model with spectral classifier in discriminators so that they could generate images with better ability in spectral domain.
* Utilized Google Cloud Platform to train different models, which helped my team save up to 80% training time.
* Presented our project in front of the whole class and received positive feedbacks.

#### CNN-based Scene Categorization (NUS, Jan 2023 - May 2023) 

* Collaborated with a group of two members to develop an application for scene categorization using Python.
* Designed Convolutional Neural Network models based on TensorFlow using Jupyter Notebook. 
* Processed thousands of images by splitting them into training and testing datasets, resized images into the same size, normalized the pixel values to range from 0 to 1, and implemented data augmentation to strengthen the generalization ability of our model.
* Developed two models and tuned hyper-parameters to reach high accuracy.
* Presented our project in front of the whole class and ranked top 3 in model accuracy.

#### Opinions Analysis on Covid-19 Pandemic (NUS, Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)

* Analyzed opinions and sentiments of pre-processed Covid-19 related tweets between Oct 2019 and Dec 2020 by conducting sentiment analysis in three different dimensions, including temporal, influencer, and frequent itemset.
* Concluded sentiment trends during Covid-19 that could be used to predict public sentiments in future pandemics using ARIMA model in Python.
* Conducted and visualize our analysis model based on Pandas, Seaborn, and WordCloud using Jupyter Notebook.
* Presented our project in front of the whole class and received positive feedbacks.

#### Web Server Implementation (NUS, Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)

* Collaborated with a group of five members to develop a simple webpage for movie theatres.
* Implemented a web server on the local host that serves two user requests using Django web-programming framework.
* Built web-based applications for movie selection using JavaScript and CSS.
* Created database to store movies’ information using SQLite.
* Presented our project in front of the whole class and received positive feedbacks.

#### Quality System Engineer (Fabrinet West, Oct 2019 - Mar 2020)

* Main responsibility covers data Analysis on Manufacturing Productivity                                                         
* Standardized, cleansed, and consolidated siloed excel spreadsheets owned by individual manufacturing operators into a single csv using Python.
* Parameterized Python script to allow producing productivity reports grouped by a selection of input parameters, such as employee name and product ID, which helped management optimize resource planning. 
* Documented future tech visions for moving local python scripts into a minimal website in production environment.

#### Data Analyst (Federal Aviation Administration, Sep 2018 - May 2019)

* Led core reliability analysis within a team of post-graduate students and professors using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib); collaborated with the team to design network analysis for the system.
* Made data-driven decisions managing risks, optimizing network, and improving infrastructure system safety; decreased facility outages caused by bad weather by 15% and delays by 40%.
